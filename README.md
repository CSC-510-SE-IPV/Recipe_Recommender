Please see our [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/SE-Fall24-RZA/Recipe_Recommender/blob/group31-fall24/CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions on how to contribute to the project by completing some of the issues.

## FUTURE SCOPE

1. Edit an Existing Recipe : Fully implement the functionality for editing a pre-existing recipe.  Whoever created the recipe should be able to make changes to any of the recipe’s details

2. Share Recipe By Link : Create a sharing method allowing a user to send a recipe to someone else via a link or QR Code. Upon opening this link, the recipient should be able to see all details about the recipe.

3. Grocery List : Users should be able to add ingredients from recipes to a separate grocery list tab. 

4. Security Enhancements : Incorporate encryption and hashing into the login functionality.  Passwords should be stored as salted and hashed, not as raw text.  Implement JSON Web Tokens to securely login users and keep track of who is logged in.  This will ensure the safety of any sensitive user data

## Troubleshooting and Support

Common issues observed and solutions:<br>

1. requirements.txt failing: this issue should no longer be seen, as we have used ~= to ensure your systems pick up versions compatible with the other packages. However, if you happen to see the issue, modify the requirements.txt file to use a more recent version.
2. python was not found: we recommend using python3 as some of the modules are available only on Python3. You may either install Python3 or setup a virtual environment(we suggest the latter if you are currently running other applications on python2)
